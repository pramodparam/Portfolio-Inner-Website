                {/* <p>
                    From a young age, I have had a curiosity about how things
                    worked. This naturally led me to become absolutely obsessed
                    with Lego and I fell in love with building things. In
                    elementary school, I joined the Lego Robotics team at my
                    local middle school, which was my first real exposure to
                    programming. In 2008, my family and I moved across the
                    country from California to New York, where I attended middle
                    school, high school, and college.

                <p>
                    I started programming more seriously in college,
                    initially learning how to scrape and interact with websites.
                    I went on to do a ton of passion projects,
                     apps, and more. One of these
                    projects is viewable on my{' '}

                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Beyond software, I have a lot of hobbies that I
                            enjoy doing in my free time. The more tangible
                            hobbies I have are games,music,cooking & travel. You can
                            read more about each of these on their respective
                            pages under my projects tab. Some other hobbies I
                            enjoy are working out, and (unsurprisingly)
                            playing video games.
